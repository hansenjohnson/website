abstract = "An Optical Plankton Counter (OPC) is an oceanographic instrument designed to count and size small particles in the water. The raw data are stored in a binary file format (typically with a .D00 file extension) designed by the manufacturer, Focal Technologies. This package provides utilities for reading in D00 files, converting them to a nice R format, and computing and plotting relevant metrics."
