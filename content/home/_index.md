My name's Hansen. I'm a marine scientist and a sailor. I work as a research scientist at the [Anderson Cabot Center for Ocean Life at the New England Aquarium](https://www.neaq.org/conservation-and-research/anderson-cabot-center-for-ocean-life/). Much of our work is dedicated to improving conservation outcomes for the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale. I use this website to highlight some of the [papers](/publication/), [presentations](/talk/), and [projects](/projects/) I've been working on. Sometimes I also write [posts](/post/) about things I think are worth remembering or sharing. If you're interested in any of this stuff, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:hjohnson@neaq.org">hjohnson@neaq.org</a>.
