My name's Hansen. I'm a marine scientist and a sailor. I work part-time as a Fishery Biologist for the [Protected Species Branch](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/new-england-mid-atlantic/protected-species-research-northeast) of the NOAA Northeast Science Center, and as a vessel captain for [Hal Whitehead's lab group](http://whitelab.biology.dal.ca/) at Dalhousie University. Much of my recent research has been dedicated to studying the acoustic and habitat ecology of the endangered North Atlantic right whale. I use this website to highlight some of the [papers](/publication/), [presentations](/talk/), and [projects](/projects/) I've been working on. Sometimes I also write [posts](/post/) about things I think are worth remembering or sharing. If you're interested in any of this stuff, please don't hesitate to get in touch! I can be reached by email at <a href="mailto:hansen.johnson@dal.ca">hansen.johnson@dal.ca</a>.
